improve marketplace notification and link to github faq answer for more detail

when running 'scan all' it should search the zune marketplace for any matches and notify the user if any are found

drop the prog bar for loading from the zune db and perhaps only show the icons once fully loaded?

allow scan all to run while db is loading AND allow sort to happen while db is loadin

investigate why the memory usage is still high after a full scan compared to a cache load

should automatically download details as app is being scrolled

only allow single instance



MAJOR:
Needs the ability to update .m4a files
