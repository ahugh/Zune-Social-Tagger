should be able to cancel/rerun scan all

handle folder path not being available if it no longer exists (select audio files) (vista/7)

the zune database crashing or not loading shouldn't kill the program. It should default back to 'select audio files'


MAJOR:
Needs the ability to update .m4a files
when running 'scan all' it should search the zune marketplace for any matches and notify the user if any are found
